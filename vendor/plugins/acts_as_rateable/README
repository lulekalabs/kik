USING THE PLUGIN
================

Pretty simple, really.  You just need to add "acts_as_rateable" at the top of your ActiveRecord model,
and everything should magically become available to you :)

	The Basics:
	===========
	Any model that acts_as_rateable has the following methods available to it:
	(see also the rdoc for FortiusOne::Acts::Rateable::ClassMethods#acts_as_rateable)
	
	rate(a_rating) : Rate the object with a_rating (integer)
	rating= : Alias for rate
	rating : Return the object's rating
	find_all_by_rating : Find all objects matching the rating criteria
	find_by_rating : Find the first object matching the rating criteria

	You can specify ratings as single integers, a list of integers, a range (setting one end of
	the range to "-1" will match all lower or higher values, depending on which end of the range
	it's on), or a mix of ranges and integers in a list (see examples below)
	
	Example:
	========
	
	class SillyWalk < ActiveRecord::Base
		# attributes: name, inventor
		acts_as_rateable
	end
	
	SillyWalk.new(:name => "Not Very Silly", :inventor => "Mr. Pudey").save
	SillyWalk.new(:name => "A Bit Silly", :inventor => "Mrs. Two-Lumps", :rating => 3).save
	SillyWalk.new(:name => "Quite Silly", :inventor => "Mr. Teabag", :rating => 5).save
	# To update the rating after creation of the initial record...
	SillyWalk.find_by_name("Not Very Silly").rate(1)
	# You could also do this
	SillyWalk.find_by_name("Not Very Silly").rating = 1
	# Retreive the rating
	SillyWalk.find_by_name("Not Very Silly").rating # => 1
	
	# Find silly walks with a rating of at least 3
	SillyWalk.find_all_by_rating(3..-1) # => ["A Bit Silly", "Quite Silly"]
	# Find silly walks with a rating of 5 (only)
	SillyWalk.find_all_by_rating(5) # => ["Quite Silly"]
	# Find silly walks with a rating of 1 or 5
	SillyWalk.find_all_by_rating([1,5]) # => ["Not Very Silly", "Quite Silly"]
	# Find silly walks with a rating between 3 and 5, inclusive
	SillyWalk.find_all_by_rating(3..5) # => ["A Bit Silly", "Quite Silly"]
	# You can also mix specific ratings and ranges...
	SillyWalk.find_all_by_rating([1,3..5]) # => ["Not Very Silly", "A Bit Silly", "Quite Silly"]
