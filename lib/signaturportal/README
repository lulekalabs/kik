German tax law requires you to sign an invoice with a valid digital signature, if you want to send it via email instead of snailmail. I wrote a script which connects to signaturportal.de and signs a given pdf.

Here are the steps to to sign your own invoices:

1. Sign up for an account at signaturportal.de
2. You have to wait for the PostIdent letter in your mailbox. This might take a few days.
3. After you confirmed your identity sign into the page and go to Einstellungen -> Webservices -> Gatewayeinstellungen
   Here you find your credentials for the service
4. Change Servie to 'WS-Soap'
5. Change Client to 'anderen wie nebenstehend'
6. Get the script from github.com either by running 
   git clone git@github.com:bigcurl/signaturportal-sign-script.git 
   or by downloading a zipped version from here.
6. Open up the script and change username, password and kontonr to your provided 
values.

You should have ruby and ruby gems installed. See your operating system manual how to install these two.

7. Install soap4r with sudo gem install soap4r

Then run ruby sign-script.rb /path_to_pdf_file

You should see a file in the same directory like your original pdf file with a '-signed' prepended to the filename.
This is your signed pdf. You can check the signature either by using Adobes Acrobat Reader which is free or use the free service provided by signaturportal.de.

Happy invoicing!
